* ideas
** return values
*** always return the same data type so frontend only needs one function
*** a vector of items to process
** generic handling of metadata
*** how to handle pagination more gracefully?
** handle frontend retractions
** handle "replace this set"
*** example: navigate to todo list, find all todo items by list id
but another user has deleted one of the todo items. how do you delete
that todo item locally?
**** could always send pagination data
**** change pagination to view
* todo
** TODO convert map nils to retractions
** TODO return nils
** TODO namespace pagination keys to sweet-tooth.pagination
** TODO optionally return attrs with entity to update attrs
** TODO auto recursive deconstruct
*** take post out of topic and into its own type key
** TODO add testing harness
** datomic integrant endpoint doesn't belong here
** still no easy way to get started with a datomic app
** better error handling for missing files
** better error handling for missing transform (datomic booties)
** pagination sort text case-insensitive
